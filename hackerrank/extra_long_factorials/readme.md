**Function Description**

Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

*n: an integer*

Note: Factorials of  `n > 20` can't be stored even in a `64-bit` long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

Input Format

Input consists of a single integer `n`

Constraints

 `1 <= n <= 100`

Output Format

Print the factorial of `n`.

Sample Input

`25`

Sample Output

`15511210043330985984000000`
