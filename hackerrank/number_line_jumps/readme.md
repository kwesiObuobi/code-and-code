# Number Line Jumps

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

- The first kangaroo starts at location `x1` and moves at a rate of `v1` meters per jump.
- The second kangaroo starts at location `x2` and moves at a rate of `v2` meters per jump.

You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.
