# camelCase

There is a sequence of words in CamelCase as a string of letters, `s`, having the following properties:

- It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
- All letters in the first word are lowercase.
- For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is uppercase and rest of the letters are lowercase.
Given `s`, determine the number of words in `s`.

Example
```s = oneTwoThree```
There are `s` words in the string: 'one', 'Two', 'Three'.
